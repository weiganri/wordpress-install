{"name":"Wordpress-install","tagline":"Installation of Wordpress on Debian and Ubuntu","body":"Hello, welcome to the github project page of the Wordpress auto-installation script for Ubuntu and Debian. We work hard, to get things done better. But at the top you can download the latest release.\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\nIf you use Ubuntu or Debian there are just a few steps needed to get a full running Wordpress Server just out of the box.\r\n\r\nFirst you have  to get the code. So login into putty or directly into your terminal and paste the following commands:\r\n```\r\n$ cd\r\n$ sudo apt-get install git\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/weiganri/wordpress-install.git\r\n$ cd wordpress-install\r\n```\r\nNow you will have to start the installation-routine:\r\n```\r\n$ sudo bash install.sh\r\n```\r\nAnswer all questions with \"Yes\" and \"Enter\" and paste in youre favourite password for the root user of the mysql server.\r\n\r\nThen open http://youip/phpmyadmin and you'll see a new Database. That's your base for installation of Wordpress.\r\n\r\nGo now to http://yourip and type in all database settings you've configured in the setup in your terminal or ssh client. Then go to the next step, copy the code in the text box and get back to terminal.\r\n\r\nNow paste the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ sudo nano wp-config.php\r\n```\r\nRight-klick and paste Klick ctrl + w Klick Y\r\n\r\nGo back to your opened browser tab and klick on \"let's go\". And now have fun with your new Wordpress Blog.\r\n\r\n# Development\r\n\r\nI work hard to get a full automated process running, but at the moment I have some problems in development because the advanced code is very buggy and not tested now. Look at the list below to get an overview what I will implement in the next time into the script:\r\n\r\n* Generating the full wp-config file in terminal\r\n* Configuring the packages by choosing in terminal\r\n* Automatticaly installer for name servers\r\n* FTP Access\r\n* Full Wordpress installation in Terminal\r\n* and much more...\r\n\r\nStay tuned :)\r\n\r\nAnd in the next time you'll get an installer for Cent OS and BSD, too (if there is a wish for this)\r\n\r\n# Contact\r\n\r\nAnyway you can contact me over the website [http://rico-weigand.de](http://rico-weigand.de/?lang=en) or for german users [here](http://rico-weigand.de/?lang=de). Over contact you can get in touch with me.","google":"UA-40305251-2","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
